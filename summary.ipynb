    "# Section 1: Introduction\n",
    "In this section I will clearly define the idea of my choosing, where I leverage the Foursquare location data to solve the imagined business opportunity.\n",
    "Background\n",
    "There are 100's, maybe even 1000's, of travel sites on the Internet, including FourSquare, that will tell you all about places to go, things to see, restaurants to eat at, bars to drink in, nightclubs to part the night away in and then where to go in the morning to get breakfast and a strong coffee. The problems with these sites is that they are one dimensional. If you want to find out all this information about a city you plan to visit next month, you have to do the hard work. Also, just because a venue is the hottest place to go for a night out does not always mean that the unwitting tourist should just ramble in unprepared. The areas surrounding this new venue might be riddled with crime including muggings, car theft and assault, for example. Approach the venue from any direction other than from the north and you could be putting your life in danger. This is when my idea comes in.\n",
    "Imagine the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.\tYou like to plan ahead and always review your options and make your choices about where you will visit and eat up front before you travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.\tYou are flying to San Francisco for a Data Science Conference.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.\tYou arrive in san Francisco the day the conference starts but you've managed to convince your boss to delay your return by a few days giving you time to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.\tBut you know no one in san Francisco to show you around to all the top sites and to bring you to the best restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5.\tAlso the last time you went to a conference you were mugged and had you passport. money and credit cards stolen so you're now nervous of going somewhere without first researching the venue and the surrounding area.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6.\tThe conference is next week and you don't have time to do all the research you'd like.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you do ... ?\n",
    "Project Idea\n",
    "My idea for the Capstone Project is to show that when driven by venue and location data from FourSquare, backed up with open source crime data, that it is possible to present the cautious and nervous traveller with a list of attractions to visit supplementd with a graphics showing the occurance of crime in the region of the venue.\n",
    "A high level approach is as follows:\n",
    "##### 1.\tThe travelers decides on a city location [in this case san Francisco ]\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.\tThe ForeSquare website is scrapped for the top venues in the city\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.\tFrom this list of top venues the list is augmented with additional geographical data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.\tUsing this additional geographical data the top nearby restaurants are selects\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5.\tThe historical crime within a predetermined distance of all venues are obtained\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6.\tA map is presented to the to the traveler showing the selected venues and crime statistics of the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7.\tThe future probability of a crime happening near or around the selected top sites is also presented to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is this solution targeted at\n",
    "This solution is targeted at the cautious traveler. The want to see all the main sites of a city that they have never visited before but at the same time, for whatever reasons unknown, they want to be able to do all that they can to make sure that they stay clear of trouble i.e. is it safe to visit this venue and this restaurant at 4:00 pm in the afternoon.\n",
    "Some examples of envisioned users include:\n",
    "•\tA single white female traveler\n",
    "•\tAn elderly traveler that has had previous back experiences when travelling\n",
    "There are many data science aspect of this project including:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.\tData Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.\tData Cleansing\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.\tData Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.\tMachine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5.\tPrediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the conference is over the Data Scientist can explore san Francisco and feel much safer.\n",
    "Section 2: Data\n",
    "Data Description\n",
    "In this section, I will describe the data used to solve the problem as described previously.\n",
    "As noted below in the Further Development Section, it is possible to attempt quite complex and sophisticated scenarios when approaching this problem. However, given the size of the project and for simplicity only the following scenario will be addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.\tQuery the FourSqaure website for the top sites in san Francisco\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.\tUse the FourSquare API to get supplemental geographical data about the top sites\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.\tUse the FourSquare API to get top restaurent recommendations closest to each of the top site\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.\tUse open source san Francisco Crime data to provide the user with additional crime data\n",
    "\n",

    "# Conclusions and Discussions\n",
    "Although all of the goals of this project were met there is definitely room for further improvement and development as noted below. However, the goals of the project were met and, with some more work, could easily be developed into a fully pledged application that could support the cautious traveler in an unknown location.\n",
    "Of the contributing data the san Francisco Crime data is the one where more data would be good to have. Also not every city in the world makes this data freely available so that is a drawback.\n",
    "FourSquare proved to be a good source of data but frustrating at times. Despite having a Developer account I regularly exceeded my hourly limit locking me out for the day. This is why Pickle was used to store the captured data.\n"
